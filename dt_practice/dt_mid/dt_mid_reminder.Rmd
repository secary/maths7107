```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Load the packages and data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(inspectdf)
data('midwest')
```

# Build a separate linear model
```{r}

# Build a multiple regression linear model by states, with separate lines 
mw_sep <- lm(percollege ~ log(poptotal)+state+log(poptotal):state, 
             data=midwest)
summary(mw_sep)
```

# Separate lines
```{r}
anova(mw_sep)
```
The line which has a p-value greater than 0.05 should be separated.

# Predict the data
```{r}
# Predict an individual sample of 10000 population county in Ohio
pred_value <- tibble(poptotal = 10000, state = 'OH')
predict(mw_sep, pred_value, interval = 'prediction', level = 0.95)
```
